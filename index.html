            <div class="attribution">&mdash; Douglas Coupland</div>
            <p>Making what's next comes with unexpected twists and turns. In new territories, design transforms ambiguity into vision.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Design can change the world</h2>
            <p>Design is more than just a visual veneer. Design shapes science, technology, business and culture into human experiences. Design is the application of empathy, creativity, and understanding to solve genuine human needs.</p>
            <p>Great design can make life better, meaning clearer, and action effortless. When applied with technology, design can transform daily activities or entire industries.</p>
            <p>Designers must give the things we make a purpose. With purpose comes meaning, resonance, and a way to gauge impact.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Change is constant</h2>
            <p>Digital products are moving away from fixed visual interfaces and into flexible, changing ecosystems of services - physical, digital, social, conversational, predictive - that each person will experience slightly differently.</p>
            <p>In this environment of continuous development, design is the unifying voice that creates a sense of coherence and continuity.</p>
            <p>This means that design must adapt and grow too. Design isn’t a compartmentalised process, it’s a living part of a business.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="left">Technology is for humans</h2>
            <p>Laurie Anderson said “technology is the camp-fire around which we tell our stories.” Telling stories is a great way to keep technological conversations focused on people.</p>
            <p>Building products using stories as a guide helps the people that are making them. Making products that have a story to tell helps customers connect with them.</p>
            <p>Designers must work backwards from human needs to craft into our products the stories that resonate with our customers.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Innovation is not a luxury</h2>
            <p>Innovative products and communications aren’t a luxury, they are crucial to standing out in the crowded digital landscape.</p>
            <p>Customers are never more than a click away from competitors. Design means constantly evaluating, iterating and evolving products to keep competitors at bay, grow sales, and keep customers engaged.</p>
