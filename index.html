            <div class="attribution">&mdash; Douglas Coupland</div>
            <p>Making what's next comes with unexpected twists and turns. In new territories, design transforms ambiguity into vision.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Design can change the world</h2>
            <p>Design is more than just a visual veneer. Design shapes science, technology, business and culture into human experiences. Design is the application of empathy, creativity, and understanding to solve genuine human needs.</p>
            <p>Great design can make life better, meaning clearer, and action effortless. When applied with technology, design can transform daily activities or entire industries.</p>

                <h3>An Agent for Change</h3>
                <p>Design is a voice for what's possible, crystallising opportunity and creativity into vision and purpose. Design offers a way of thinking that clarifies problems and puts people first.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="label">Design is</div>
                <h3>A Business Partner</h3>
                <p>Design keeps businesses competitive and relevant to customers. Design brings deliberateness, clarity and shapes intentions. Design is a differentiator and builds trusting relationships.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="label">Design is</div>
                <h3>A Consistent Companion</h3>
                <p>When customer experiences are atomised across mediums, interfaces and devices, design offers continuity. Design also bridges specialisms and silos to help organisations work better as a system.</p>

                <h3>A New Way Forward</h3>
                <p>The pace of change has increased so much that change is now the norm. Design finds new paths — it makes innovation tangible. Design redefines challenges and exposes opportunity in crisis.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Change is constant</h2>
            <p>Digital products are moving away from fixed visual interfaces and into flexible, changing ecosystems of services - physical, digital, social, conversational, predictive - that each person will experience slightly differently.</p>
            <p>In this environment of scattered experiences, design is the unifying voice that creates a sense of coherence and continuity.</p>
            <p>This means that design must adapt and grow too. Design mustn’t be a compartmentalised process, it’s a living part of a business.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="left">Innovation is not a luxury</h2>
            <p>Innovative products and communications aren’t a luxury, they are crucial to standing out in the crowded digital landscape.</p>
            <p>Customers are never more than a tap away from competitors. Design means constantly evaluating, iterating and evolving products to keep competitors at bay, grow sales, and keep customers engaged.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Technology is for humans</h2>
            <p>Laurie Anderson said “technology is the camp-fire around which we tell our stories.” Our technologies are for enabling us and extending the range of essential human behaviours: community, collaboration, communication.</p>
            <p>When creating products, it's all too easy to get carried away focusing on features and details &mdash; rather than the people we're building them for.</p>
            <p>Good design starts from cutomer needs, but we need to keep those needs at the centre of what we do.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="left">Moments matter</h2>
            <p>Customer decision-making doesn’t unfold like a game of Pac-Man. There are many steps that play a role in the journeys customers take through our products.</p>
            <p>Looking at the whole customer journey we can see which steps make the most difference, or have the greatest potential for impact.</p>
            <p>By looking at how customer needs and feelings change from step-to-step, we can make those keystone moments more effective.</p>
