            <h2 class="left">Design can change the world</h2>
            <p>Design is more than just a visual veneer. Design shapes science, technology, business and culture into human experiences. Design is the application of processes and tools, creativity, and understanding to solve genuine human needs.</p>
            <p>Great design can make life better, meaning clearer, and action effortless. When applied with technology, design can transform daily activities or entire industries.</p>

                <h3>An Agent for Change</h3>
                <p>Design is a voice for what's possible, crystallising opportunity and creativity into vision and purpose. Design prioritises solving problems and puts people first.</p>

                <p>Design keeps businesses competitive and relevant to customers. Design brings deliberateness, clarity and shapes intentions. Design is a differentiator and builds trusting customer relationships.</p>

                <h3>A Consistent Companion</h3>
                <p>When customer experiences are atomised across mediums, interfaces and devices, design offers continuity. Design also bridges specialisms and silos to help organisations work better as a system.</p>

                <p>The pace of change has increased so much that change is now the norm. Design finds new paths — it makes innovation tangible. Design redefines challenges and exposes opportunity in crisis.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Change is constant</h2>
            <p>Digital products are moving away from fixed visual interfaces and into flexible, changing ecosystems of services - physical, digital, social, conversational, predictive - that each person will experience slightly differently.</p>
            <p>In this environment of scattered experiences, design is the unifying voice that creates a sense of coherence and continuity.</p>
            <p>This means that design must adapt and grow too. Design mustn’t be a compartmentalised process, it’s a living part of a business.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Innovation is not a luxury</h2>
            <p>Innovative products and communications aren’t a luxury, they are crucial to standing out in the crowded digital landscape.</p>
            <p>Customers are never more than a tap away from competitors. Design means constantly evaluating, iterating and evolving products to keep competitors at bay, grow sales, and keep customers engaged.</p>

            <h2 class="right">Technology is for humans</h2>
            <p>Laurie Anderson said “technology is the camp-fire around which we tell our stories.” Our technologies are for enabling us and extending the range of essential human behaviours: community, collaboration, communication.</p>
            <p>When creating products, it's all too easy to get carried away focusing on features and details &mdash; rather than the people we're building them for.</p>
            <p>Good design starts from cutomer needs, but we need to keep those needs at the centre of what we do.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Moments matter</h2>
            <p>Customer decision-making doesn’t unfold like a game of Pac-Man. There are many steps that play a role in the journeys customers take through our products.</p>
            <p>Looking at the whole customer journey we can see which steps make the most difference, or have the greatest potential for impact.</p>
            <p>By looking at how customer needs and feelings change from step-to-step, we can make those keystone moments more effective.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Design outcomes, not outputs</h2>
            <p>Outcomes are the customer actions and behaviours that drive business value. Design works best when it's tasked with accomplishing outcomes, such as creating behaviour change, rather than delivering outputs, such as a design for a specific feature.</p>
            <p>Thinking about outcomes keeps us focused on delivering real business value, while remaining open to different solutions and mediums - whichever answers that need most effectively. Outputs presume a solution and prescribe the medium that delivers it.</p>
            <p>Considering outcomes, designers can keep an open mind, discover inspiration in unexpected places and find solutions beyond the interface, in brand, strategy, process and more.</p>
