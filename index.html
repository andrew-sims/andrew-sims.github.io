            <div class="quote">"You know the future is really happening when you start feeling scared"</div>
            <div class="attribution">&mdash; Douglas Coupland</div>
            <p>Making what's next comes with unexpected twists and turns. In new territories, design transforms ambiguity into vision.</p>

            <h2 class="left">Design can change the world</h2>
            <p>Design is more than just a visual veneer. Design shapes science, technology, business and culture into human experiences. Design is the application of empathy, creativity, and understanding to solve genuine human needs.</p>
            <p>Great design can make life better, meaning clearer, and action effortless. When applied with technology, design can transform daily activities or entire industries.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="right">Change is constant</h2>
            <p>Digital products are moving away from fixed visual interfaces and into flexible, changing ecosystems of services - physical, digital, social, conversational, predictive - that each person will experience slightly differently.</p>
            <p>In this environment of continuous development, design is the unifying voice that creates a sense of coherence and continuity.</p>
            <p>This means that design must adapt and grow too. Design isn’t a compartmentalised process, it’s a living part of a business.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="left">Innovation is not a luxury</h2>
            <p>Innovative products and communications aren’t a luxury, they are crucial to standing out in the crowded digital landscape.</p>
            <p>Customers are never more than a click away from competitors. Design means constantly evaluating, iterating and evolving products to keep competitors at bay, grow sales, and keep customers engaged.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="right">Technology is for humans</h2>
            <p>Laurie Anderson said “technology is the camp-fire around which we tell our stories.” Telling stories is a great way to keep technological conversations focused on people.</p>
            <p>Building products using stories as a guide helps the people that are making them. Making products that have a story to tell helps customers connect with them.</p>
            <p>Designers must work backwards from human needs to craft into our products the stories that resonate with our customers.</p>

        <div class="main-copy">
            <h2 class="left">Moments matter</h2>
            <p>Looking at the big picture of how experiences fit together gives us a better view of what individual steps need to deliver. We need to look at the whole customer journey.</p>
            <p>If we consider how previous steps will effect customer’s needs and feelings, and what future steps we need to prepare for: we can make the current moment more effective.</p>
            <p>That big picture also gives us a view on which steps in the journey will be the most effective, or offer the greatest opportunity. This helps us to focus on developing experiences that have the greatest potential for impact.</p>
